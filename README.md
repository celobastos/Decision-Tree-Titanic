# Titanic Machine Learning Project

This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers in the famous Titanic disaster. The code was developed as a Jupyter notebook using the Python language and several libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.

Implemented Features:

Data Loading: The code loads the Titanic training and test datasets, which are in CSV format.

Data Exploration: An exploratory analysis of the data is performed to understand its structure and characteristics. This includes information about the columns, statistical description of numerical variables, visualization of histograms, and correlation matrix between variables.

Feature Engineering: New variables are created from the existing ones in the dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models. These variables include simplification of cabins, ticket types, people's titles, among others.

Data Preprocessing: The data is prepared for model training. This involves handling missing values, selecting relevant variables, transforming categorical variables into numerical variables, and normalizing the data.

Model Training: Two machine learning models are trained: Decision Tree and Random Forest. A hyperparameter search is performed to find the best configurations for each model.

Model Evaluation: Predictions are made on the training and test sets, and the models' performance is evaluated using classification metrics. Classification reports are generated for each model, showing metrics such as precision, recall, and f1-score.

How to Run the Code:

To run the code, you need to have the Jupyter Notebook environment set up and all the required libraries installed. It is recommended to use the latest version of Python.

Download the "Final_Version_SI_titanic.ipynb" file.

Open Jupyter Notebook.

Navigate to the directory where the downloaded file is located.

Open the "Final_Version_SI_titanic.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook.

Execute each code cell sequentially to follow the project flow and view the results.

Make sure that the Titanic training and test datasets are in the same directory as the notebook file, with the names "train.csv" and "test.csv," respectively.

Important Notes:

The code was developed as an educational project to demonstrate different stages of a machine learning project. There may be areas that can be optimized or improved in a real production environment.

Some code cells are hidden in the provided code. They may contain additional information, auxiliary code, or visualizations that were not shown in the transcription.

Make sure to understand the code and applied techniques before using it in other projects. It is recommended to customize and adapt the code according to specific project requirements.
